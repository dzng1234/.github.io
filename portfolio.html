   <p> <font size="5">Our app functions as music player that can play certain musics while lowering the volume. For the most part our app worked, however, we were unable to get the volume button to completely work. We could make our product better by fixing this volume button and possibly adding more songs. In order to put this app on the store, we would need to garner more songs that appeal to a wider audience.</font></p>
